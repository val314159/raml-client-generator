## Raml->python generator
----

This package uses [raml-client-generator](https://github.com/mulesoft/raml-client-generator) as a framework for generating macro files.  (You may also just use the language/python directory as a plug-in, if you're using more than just python)

----

### How to Install it

for the code generation, you'll need to run

```sh
npm install
```

### How to Run it

```sh
sh test.sh
```

This will generate a bunch of python files in the directory 'igpy' for various python web clients and servers.

For more details of what's generated, see the README.md in the language/python folder.
